Word Countess
=============

A Google Docs extension

Features
--------
* sum word count across multiple documents
* set long-term and short-term word count goals
* chart word count over time

This code is here mostly for display purposes. It's a Google Docs add-on, so if you just want to use it, by far the easiest way is to download it from the app store. Feel free to contribute, report bugs, or add features, though.
